# Let's use some in-memory caching to reduce the number of runtime lookups against Stormpath.  A real
# application might want to use a more robust caching solution (e.g. ehcache or a distributed cache).  When using such
# caches, be aware of your cache TTL settings: too high a TTL and the cache won't reflect any potential
# changes in Stormpath fast enough.  Too low and the cache could evict too often, reducing performance.
